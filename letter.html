  <h1 class="fade">My Love Letter to You</h1>

  <section class="letter fade">
  <p>Baby, every moment with you is magic. From the first time I saw your beautiful green eyes, I knew my world had changed. Your smile lights up every room and every moment we share feels like a dream I never want to wake up from.</p>

  <p>I love the way you touch me when you’re happy or excited — it’s like your love reaches straight to my heart. The first time I held you while you cried, I felt so honored that you trusted me with your heart. You’ve shown me what it truly means to care for someone, and you treat me better than I ever imagined anyone could.</p>

  <p>Every laugh we share, every quiet moment together, every adventure we’ve gone on — they’re all pieces of a story I hope never ends. You make ordinary days feel extraordinary, and even the simplest things become beautiful when I’m with you. I love how your presence calms me, how your voice makes everything feel right, and how your smile reminds me that love is the most powerful thing in the world.</p>

  <p>Baby, thank you for being you — for your kindness, your warmth, your humor, and your heart. Thank you for loving me and letting me love you. I promise to cherish you, to make you laugh, to hold you when you need it, and to stand by your side no matter what. You are my heart, my home, and the love of my life.</p>

  <p>Forever yours,</p>
  <p><strong>Jackson</strong></p>
